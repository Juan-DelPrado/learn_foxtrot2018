// If/else challenges 11.29.18
//
// Write an if/else statement that considers two variables (numbers) and returns/logs the higher number.  Have “catch all” statement that takes care of numbers that are equal.
//
//
// Arrays
//
// Start w/ and empty array
// Push 4 names into the array
// Start another empty array
// Push 4 names into that array
// Combine the two arrays into a new array without changing the original array




// Loops challenges 11.30.18
//write 3 loops (1 for loop, 1 while loop and 1 forEach loop) that iterates through an array and returns the same array with every number mult. by 3.

var arr1 = [3, 8, 20, 4, 2]

//expected output [9, 24, 60, 12, 6]


// for loop


// //while loop


// //forEach


//stretch 1:  Turn each loop into a function.

//stretch 2:  Refactor your function to return a new array instead of mutating the original arry
